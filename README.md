# Nucleo_F103
This repository is holding my experiment about ARM microcontrollers.

## I'm using nucleo F103 development board from ST.
I use VSCode most of the time for coding as in this project too and 
I'm usingSTM32CubeMX for generating codebase.
For compilation I'm using arm-gcc and openOCD for flashig and debuging.
